Who are you? Do you even know? Sure you&#8217;re you, and you grew up on that street with those friends. You had that family and you do those things. Everyone can say that, because everyone is that.<!--more-->

I&#8217;m going to ask you again, Do you know who you are? I do. It has absolutely nothing to do with my net worth or title. Not even my name. My name is Adam Bourg, but who I am is beyond my name. I am a strong man, I&#8217;m passionate, loving, believing and caring.

Beyond a philosophical or religious point of view. How much do you know of yourself? I&#8217;m an INTJ. I reflect when alone more then you could possibly imagine. I process, I strategize and I think non-stop when I&#8217;m alone. That&#8217;s why I love skiing, driving and staying up late.

What are your strengths? Do you know what you&#8217;re good at? At my last company, I had a friend, Dan, he is this big futuristic marketing guy who always has some crazy big idea about the future. He&#8217;s a ton of fun to be around, he got everyone in the company to read a book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Strengths Finder 2.0</a>&#8220;. The idea of the book is you take an online assessment of your strengths to determine your top 5 then you focus on building them.

For me my top 5, in order are:

  1. Futuristic
  
    People strong in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future.
  2. Significance
  
    People strong in the Significance theme want to be very important in the eyes of others. They are independent and want to be recognized.
  3. Focus
  
    People strong in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through, and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act
  4. Communication
  
    People strong in the Communication theme generally find it easy to put their thoughts into words. They are good conversationalists and presenters.
  5. Strategic
  
    People strong in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

What&#8217;s interesting is I can see my life through my strengths and how I&#8217;ve interacted with the world through them. For example, &#8220;Communication&#8221; I found during my college career that I would prefer to give oral presentations over writing a paper. Or &#8220;Futuristic&#8221;, I tend to plan out the future 5-30 years a head. I look for new opportunities and I constantly think about how something could change in the future.

My strengths combined with my personality type lead me into applying to RoundPegg.com in Boulder about a year and a half ago. They&#8217;re all about discovering what kind of culture you&#8217;d be best suited for. With their culture guide I get to see a glimpse of myself through a different perspective. When you mesh Meyers Briggs, Strengths Finder and Round Pegg, you get me in the following form:

I&#8217;m an INTJ. Who can&#8217;t stop thinking about the future, I want to be significant in the industry and in the lives of my family. I can get into the zone and insanely focus on a task. I love to communicate and I&#8217;m diligent about my planning. I&#8217;m a person who works independently, so don&#8217;t micro manage me. I like to take risks, try new things and connect with different people. I want to help you, yes even at 3 am. I want the way we&#8217;re going to be clear and my role to make sense. I need time to explore, learn and I need flexibility.

Let me ask you again. Who are you? I know who I am, and now you know more about me.
