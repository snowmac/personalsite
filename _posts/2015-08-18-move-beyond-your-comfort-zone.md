When in life do you grow the most as an individual? Is it through the easy, everything is good time of life? I doubt it; college was tough for me. I went from home schooled from K-12 to the real world of classroom learning, where I obtained knowledge by more then just reading a book.<!--more-->

College was a tough experience, I had to learn a new way of thinking and approaching learning. It was really worth that experience and has been the best investment I&#8217;ve ever made for myself. But college was really hard, in the beginning I had a D average, later I graduated with a &#8220;C&#8221; average. What else made it hard? I was working nearly 40 hours a week between internships, consulting and startup work. It was a crazy time to be alive.

Now that I&#8217;ve graduated, moved on and got married, life has gotten easy. Guys like me aren&#8217;t very happy with easy for very long. So how has my life gotten crazy again? I started a gluten free cookie company last September with my wife. We sell to coffee shops and farmers markets. We&#8217;re by the books, I&#8217;m talking commercial kitchen, UPC codes, professionally printed labels and packaging.

The next step for us is approaching large natural grocery stores, which is what we&#8217;re in the process of. Its been a crazy experience. What have I learned from this experience?

  * Sales
  * Marketing
  * Taking risks is worth it and scary at the same time
  * Stop asking for permission and go
  * Doing something today is better then doing 2 things tomorrow
  * My wife is way more supportive then I could have ever dreamed

Yes, I&#8217;ve learned a lot but I have a long way to go! Beyond cookies, when I took the job with United, it was a big step for me. I was mostly new to compliance (only worked at it from a abstract perspective before) and now thrust into a complicated world with all kinds of crazy rules and regulations.

From United, I&#8217;ve learned about: HIPAA, Compliance, Security, Scaling, MySQL optimizations and way more about SOA then I ever thought I could know. Everyday is a struggle to stay afloat in the fast paced environment to make sure our deadlines are met, we&#8217;re secure and we&#8217;re delivering highly tested, highly reliable code.

It&#8217;s a wonderful place to be. Embrace the struggle.
